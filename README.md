# Web-Dev-project-1

I made my first project on the Web Development for restaurant.
It is web page for tacos menu.Light-hearted, fun and a little bit feisty, Tacos Webflow Template is the perfect fit for food trucks, cafés, restaurants and market stalls selling food or drinks of any kind. A seamless mixture of bright color, bold type and clever graphic design fuse deliciously with a dash of fun to deliver an authentic website experience bursting with character and the spirit of good times.

# Overview

Description: This restaurant offers delivery of simple, authentic street tacos, glass bottle soft drinks, and in limited markets, cerveza.

Audience: This restaurant delivers to busy professionals too caught up to step out of the office; especially for people working in areas unserved by taco trucks.

Location: situated in Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, the main clientele might be late night workers at Google, Facebook or Amazon

Estimated Cost: $-$$; $1.50/taco, $7/burrito, $4/beer or agua fresca

Sample Menu:

Tacos: tortilla (corn or flour), filling (asada, pastor, carnitas, chicken tinga, or roasted poblanos and cheese *v*), toppings (onion/cilantro or pico de gallo), salsa (verde, rojo, crema)
Drinks: Mex. Coke, assorted Jarritos, agua de jamaica, agua de horchata, Modelo Especial (21+)
Pitch: If you love great cheap street tacos, Seattle is an underserved city. Busy professionals working late to meet that Friday deadline can indulge in classics like rich al pastor or charred carne asada, along with a refreshing agua fresca or cerveza, all at the low, accessible price tacos were meant to be.
